## Project Overview: Building an End-to-End Blog Generation Application with llama 2

In this code, we delve into the process of creating a project centered around the open-source llama 2 model, developed by Facebook (Meta), for the purpose of generating blogs using generative AI techniques. Below are the highlights of what this tutorial covers:

### Blog Generation Application

This segment focuses on the practical implementation aspect of the project. We demonstrate the creation of a blog generation application, which involves utilizing technologies:
* llama 2 model
* sentence-transformers
* ctransformers
* langchain
* streamlit

#### How UI looks
